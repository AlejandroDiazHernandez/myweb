This is a React project with npm run start.
You can also check the exercice here with this link: "https://uhomeweb.netlify.app/"

As you can see, this exercice is like a modern web where you can see smooth transitions, a nice navbar, and differents pathings.
The web is not fully ended because I use it like a exercice to train my code and styled-components.
I used styled-components library for all the styles and layouts.

This is a modern website of luxury homes for sale, the exercise I set out with this was to improve my code and put in practice 
the styled-components library. As you can see, if you navigate through it you can find a fully functional website, responsive, with good transitions and a nice presentation, all links work and redirect to their respective tab.

The web is an exercise to practice the points mentioned above.
